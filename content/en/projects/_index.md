## Building Beyond the Day Job

These projects represent my technical curiosity in action—experimenting with emerging technologies, solving real problems, and exploring ideas that might not fit within corporate constraints.

From **production-grade home automation** running on Kubernetes to **AI-powered character builders** using multi-agent systems, each project demonstrates a different facet of modern software engineering. Some are **live platforms** serving real users, others are **concept explorations** waiting for the right moment to materialize.

What ties them together is a focus on **practical solutions** that balance technical sophistication with user experience. Whether it's making music discovery safer, bringing tabletop RPG worlds to life, or applying DevOps principles to home infrastructure, these projects showcase how good engineering translates across domains.

**Explore the collection below** to see where cloud architecture meets community platforms, AI meets game design, and infrastructure as code meets smart home automation.
